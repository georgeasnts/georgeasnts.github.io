          <h2> Course Contract </h2>
         
            <p> I, <a href="introduction.html">Georgea K. Freitas, </a>agree to abide by the terms in my FALL 2023    WEB115-N801 course     with my instructor, D.I von Briesen.
            </p>
              I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
              </p>
              <p>
              I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Signed, 
            <br>
              <em>Georgea Freitas, 19 August 2023</em>
